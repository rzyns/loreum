# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### MCP Authentication & Review Queue

- **API key model**: `ApiKey` table with project scoping, hashed keys, `READ_ONLY` / `DRAFT_WRITE` / `CANONICAL_WRITE` target permissions, expiration, revocation, and last-used tracking (`READ_WRITE` remains a legacy canonical-write alias)
- **Review queue model**: `DraftProposal` and `AuditEvent` lifecycle for draft submission, review, approve/apply, reject, archive, provenance, and previous/proposed snapshots
- **MCP draft-first write surface**: HTTP-safe write tools now stage entity-create, entity-update, relationship, and lore-article drafts; legacy direct canonical write names are hidden over HTTP

- **Section 16 (Review Queue)**: Complete staging area spec with PendingChange model, write flow, diff UX for updates/creates/deletes, batch operations, collaborator suggestion mode
