## Near-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

### MCP Review Queue (Staging Area)

Legacy note: the older `PendingChange` checklist is superseded for new work by the Phase-2 `DraftProposal`/`AuditEvent` lifecycle in `AGENTIC_CMS_DRAFT_LIFECYCLE_SPEC.md` and `AGENTIC_CMS_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`. Keep `PendingChange` only as legacy schema context unless a deliberate cleanup migrates or retires it.

- [ ] DraftProposal service: create draft proposal, list by project/status/batch, approve/apply, reject
- [ ] Approve/apply logic: atomically apply `proposedData` to the target model (create/update/delete), set status to APPLIED, and append audit history
- [ ] Reject logic: reject only pre-approval states and append audit history
- [ ] Batch approve/apply: apply all eligible submitted drafts in a batch in dependency order
- [ ] Snapshot `previousData` on update/delete for diff display
- [ ] DraftProposal controller: draft-list endpoint plus target-specific approve/reject endpoints
- [ ] Route MCP write tools through DraftProposal endpoints instead of direct writes
- [ ] MCP tool responses: return confirmation that change was staged, not applied
- [ ] Review queue page: list view grouped by batch, operation badges (create/update/delete)
- [ ] Diff view for updates (side-by-side, highlight changed fields)
- [ ] Preview for creates (rendered as the record would appear)
- [ ] Delete confirmation with referencing records listed
- [ ] Per-change accept/edit/reject buttons
- [ ] Batch accept/reject buttons
- [ ] Sidebar badge showing pending change count
- [ ] Notification when new pending changes arrive

### MCP Read Tools + Search (next priority)

See [MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) Phase 3 for full context.

**Search** (API work — endpoint exists as stub, needs real implementation):

- [ ] Implement Prisma `contains` search across entities, lore, timeline, scenes
- [ ] Return unified result format with type labels and excerpts

**Read tools** (MCP-side only — all API endpoints exist):

- [ ] `list_projects` - list user's projects
- [ ] `get_project` - project detail
- [ ] `list_relationships` - relationships, optionally filtered by entity
- [ ] `get_timeline` - timeline events with filters
- [ ] `get_timeline_event` - single event detail
- [ ] `list_eras` - eras for a project
- [ ] `list_lore_articles` - filter lore articles
- [ ] `get_lore_article` - single lore article
- [ ] `list_tags` - all tags in a project
- [ ] `get_plotline` - plotline with plot points
- [ ] `get_work` - work with chapters and scene structure
- [ ] `list_scenes` - scenes in a chapter (narrative content)

**Quality pass:**

- [ ] Improve tool descriptions
- [ ] Response shaping (strip noise, flatten nesting)
- [ ] `api()` error handling (structured MCP errors)

### MCP Write Tools (blocked on Review Queue)

- [ ] `update_lore_article`
- [ ] `delete_entity`
- [ ] `delete_relationship`
- [ ] `delete_lore_article`
- [ ] `create_timeline_event`
- [ ] `update_timeline_event`
- [ ] `delete_timeline_event`
- [ ] `create_scene`
- [ ] `update_scene`
- [ ] `create_plot_point`
- [ ] `update_plot_point`

### Global Design & Polish

- [ ] Global design pass - typography, spacing, color consistency
- [ ] Responsive polish (mobile nav, sidebar behavior)
- [ ] Screenshot/GIF in README (after UX pass)
- [ ] Smoke test: login > create project > create entity > view graph > storyboard flow

### UX Polish

#### Storyboard

- [ ] Scenes: multi-character picker (SceneCharacter join table exists, no UI)
- [ ] Scenes: timeline event link in create/edit forms
- [ ] Plot points: support multiple entities (separate pickers for Characters, Locations, Orgs, item types)

#### Entities

- [ ] Configurable field schemas for Characters, Locations, Organizations (same pattern as Items - add `fieldSchema` JSON column). Hardcoded fields become defaults. Enables RPG stats (STR, DEX, etc.), custom attributes per project
- [ ] Create entity dialog: add secrets, notes fields
- [ ] Organization member management UI (OrgMember table exists, no UI)

#### Lore

- [ ] Add connected entities from the lore article UI
- [ ] What other metadata does lore need? (hierarchy, backlinks, etc.)

#### Architecture

- [ ] Extract detail page content into reusable components for future tabbed/split-pane views

---

## Long-Term

### Site Pages

- [ ] `/migrate` - Migration guides from World Anvil, Campfire, Notion, ChatGPT/AI exports
- [ ] `/whats-new` - Changelog/updates feed (pulled from releases or markdown)
- [ ] `/docs` - User documentation (getting started, features walkthrough)
- [ ] `/docs/mcp` - MCP server setup guide for Claude Desktop, API keys
- [ ] `/docs/api` - REST API documentation (link to Swagger + key endpoints)
- [ ] `/updates` - Development blog / release notes with screenshots

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Deploy staging at staging.loreum.app (when needed)
- [ ] Dev tunnel with Cloudflare Access (dev.loreum.app)
- [ ] PR → staging → main workflow
- [ ] Webhook-based deploy from GitHub

### Style Guide

- [ ] Add `StyleGuide` model to Prisma schema (one per project, structured text fields)
- [ ] Add `voiceNotes` field to `Character` extension
- [ ] Add `styleNotes` field to `Scene` model
- [ ] Prisma migration
- [ ] Style guide service + controller (GET/PUT `/projects/:slug/style-guide`)
- [ ] MCP tool: `get_style_guide` - read tool (blocked on style guide model/service/controller)
- [ ] MCP tool: `set_style_guide` - write tool (blocked on style guide + review queue)
- [ ] Style guide wizard UI (step-by-step: dropdowns for POV/tense/voice/tone, text areas for rules/examples)
- [ ] Style guide editor UI (full form view, accessible after wizard or directly)
- [ ] Trigger wizard on project creation (optional) + accessible from style guide page any time
- [ ] Scene create/edit form: add `styleNotes` textarea
- [ ] Character create/edit form: add `voiceNotes` textarea

### Onboarding

- [ ] Template wizard - guided onboarding flow: pick a genre template → name your world → create first characters/locations/factions → launch into a pre-configured project. Eliminates blank canvas problem. Templates pre-configure entity types, field schemas, tags, and optional plot structures

### Entities

- [ ] Image upload per entity (needs R2/S3 integration)

### Phase 1 - Polish

- [ ] Rich text editor (TipTap + ProseMirror)
- [ ] Wiki-style linking (`[[entity]]`)
- [ ] Search filters (type, tag, date range)
- [ ] Export as JSON/markdown
- [ ] OpenSearch integration for full-text search

### Phase 2 - Pro + Billing

- [ ] Stripe integration (checkout, webhooks, subscriptions)
- [ ] Free/Pro tier gating
- [ ] Additional OAuth providers (Discord, GitHub)
- [ ] Email notifications via Resend
- [ ] MCP review queue (see dedicated section above)

### Phase 3 - Collaboration

- [ ] Team invitations + roles (owner, editor, viewer, commenter)
- [ ] Real-time collaborative editing (Yjs + y-websocket + TipTap)
- [ ] Presence indicators (cursors)
- [ ] Activity feed / audit log
- [ ] Entity versioning / history

### Phase 4 - Game Design

- [ ] Quest/story flowchart - branching narrative editor using React Flow node graph. Model quest paths, decision points, and outcomes as connected nodes with choice/condition edges
- [ ] Dialogue editor - conversation tree builder with speakers, lines, conditions, and branching responses. Structured tree UI distinct from the flowchart
- [ ] Maps - interactive pan/zoom, pin entity locations with coordinates, multiple layers, drawing tools (borders, routes)
- [ ] Plot structure templates - Hero's Journey, Save the Cat, Snowflake Method, or create your own

### Phase 5 - AI + Advanced

- [ ] In-app AI chat (query your world, talk to characters, roleplay - grounded in your lore)
- [ ] AI writing assistance in scene editor
- [ ] Consistency checking - AI-powered contradiction and timeline conflict detection
- [ ] AI image generation (Pro) - character portraits, location art, scene illustrations from lore context. Also produces marketing/promo assets for the platform
- [ ] PDF export (world bible / campaign sourcebook with entity cards, chapters, lore - ready to print)
- [ ] PDF/image import - upload existing notes, campaign PDFs, handwritten scans to bootstrap a project
- [ ] Free generators (no account required) - character, name, location, monster generators. SEO acquisition funnel
- [ ] i18n

### Phase 6 - Platform

- [ ] Offline desktop app - work without internet, sync when reconnected
- [x] API key generation + bearer auth
- [ ] REST API documentation page (`/docs/api`)
- [ ] Rate limiting per API key
- [ ] Webhook support (entity created/updated/deleted events)
- [ ] Cultures & species modules - dedicated modules for languages, rituals, value systems, biological traits
- [ ] Discovery & magic systems - track technologies, magic schools, spells, and their interactions
- [ ] Session notes (TTRPG) - per-session notes linked to timeline events, with audio summary import
