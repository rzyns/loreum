        <h1>Using AI to Read and Write Your World: MCP for Worldbuilders</h1>

        <p className="lead text-muted-foreground">
          Loreum includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI
          assistants like Claude read your world data and propose changes that
          you review before they go live. Here is what that means and why it
          matters.

            Screen recording: asking Claude about your world via MCP
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What is MCP?</h2>
        <p>
          MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets AI
          assistants connect to external tools and data sources. When you
          connect Loreum&apos;s MCP server to Claude, the AI can search your
          entities, read relationships, browse the timeline, pull your style
          guide, and propose new content, all through structured tools backed by
          your world&apos;s API.
        </p>

        <h2>What can you do with it?</h2>

        <h3>Ask questions about your world</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Who are Luke Skywalker&apos;s allies?&quot; Claude queries the
          knowledge graph and returns a natural language answer. No more
          scrolling through pages to find a connection.
        </p>

        <h3>Check for consistency</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Is there anything contradictory about the timeline of the
          Galactic Civil War?&quot; Claude reads your timeline events, cross-
          references entity appearances, and flags potential issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Generate content in your style</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Write a backstory for this new character that fits with the
          existing faction dynamics.&quot; Claude reads the relevant factions,
          relationships, lore, and your style guide, then generates a backstory
          that is consistent with both your world and your prose style.
        </p>

        <h3>Create and modify world data</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Create a new location called the Iron Citadel in the Northern
          Wastes.&quot; Claude calls the create tool and the proposed entity
          lands in your review queue. You see a preview of the new entity and
          can accept, edit, or reject it before it touches your canon.
        </p>

        <h2>The Review Queue</h2>
        <p>
          Every write operation from the MCP server creates a pending change
          instead of modifying your world directly. You review these changes
          from a dedicated staging area in the web UI. Updates show a
          side-by-side diff. Creates show a full preview. Deletes show what will
          be removed and what references it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changes from a single AI session are grouped together, so you can
          review them in context and batch-accept if you trust the output.
        </p>

        <h2>How to set it up</h2>
        <p>
          Generate an API key from your project settings, then add the MCP
          server to your Claude Desktop config:
        </p>

        <pre className="rounded-lg bg-muted p-4 text-sm">
          {`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loreum": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/loreum/apps/mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_API_BASE_URL": "https://loreum.app/v1",
        "MCP_API_TOKEN": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}`}
        </pre>

        <h2>Read tools (11)</h2>
        <p>
          Query your world data: search across all content, get individual
          entities with their relationships and lore, browse the storyboard,
          read the timeline, pull the style guide, and list lore articles. These
          work with both read-only and read-write API keys.
        </p>

        <h2>Write tools (16)</h2>
        <p>
          Create, update, and delete entities, relationships, lore articles,
          timeline events, scenes, plot points, and the style guide. All writes
          go through the review queue. Requires a read-write API key.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p>
          Most AI writing tools work in isolation. They generate text without
          context. With MCP, the AI has access to your entire world: characters,
          backstories, faction dynamics, timeline, and your writing style. The
          generated content is grounded in your world instead of generic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The review queue means you stay in control. The AI proposes and you
          decide. No surprises in your canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MCP server is free and open source. You bring your own AI and
          tokens. No vendor lock-in, no per-query charges from Loreum.
        </p>
